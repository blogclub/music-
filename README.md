# WWW

This is the repo of [my personal website](https://cf233.ga). It was built with Next.JS, TailwindCSS and MDX.JS. This website is minmal and it was inspired by Paco Coursey. You can clone it and used it as your personal website freely.

```
git clone https://github.com/Cloudflare233/www
```

``` 
cd www
```

```
yarn dev
```

Then you can simply open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and edit the content of `/lib/me.js` and `/pages/index.js`, then you'll make it and get a completely good looking and fast new personal website.
